Explanation:

Account Mangers deal with marketing promotional; thus, they only need to view tables containing relevant information to marking. They get the listed privileges above from PROMOTION table, so they can work on marketing promotions like promotions based on customer’s previous purchase or for specific books.

Data Entry Clerks keeps the inventory up to date, therefore, they get the listed privileges above, in order for them to perform daily duty (add new books and publishers, change price etc…) on these relevant tables: BOOKS, BOOKAUTHOR, AUTHOR, PUBLISHER.  They have no access to other tables because those tables contain information irrelevant to them.

Customer Service Representative process orders, therefore, they get the listed privilege above, in order for them to perform daily duty (add new customers, enter orders etc…) on these relevant tables: CUSTOMERS, ORDERS, ORDERITEMS. They have no access to other tables because those tables contain information irrelevant to them.
